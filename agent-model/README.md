# Agent Model

We look at how the Ambassador Program operates, learns, and interacts within its ecosystem.

Here, we list Program services, limitations, and the ways we store our memory.\
This will help us to clarify our current roles and capabilities.

Subsections:

What services we offer?

* Our services have a very wide range, but seem be mostly about digital transformation, organising virtual spaces and creating educational content.&#x20;

What are our limitations?

* Our main limitations are time and capacity for leaders in the program.
* We also have financial limitations compared to the collective capacity of all contributors.
* There are also regulatory challenges which do not allow us to scale or offer all our services.

How do we store assets and experiences?

* We have made progress on disseminating our knowledge and storing it, leveraging innovative ways to store assets and experiences.
