# What are our limitations?

**Resource Management - Time and Treasury**

The tools we need to collaborate effectively do not yet exist!\
Instead we are combining a lot of different special purpose tools and methods to achieve the required results while also keeping the process transparent and collaborative.

We have defined access to budget requests and limits to keep the collaboration sustainable for long periods even when tokenomic factors get challenging.\


**Security and Privacy**

We have defined decision-making roles and processes to define key people of responsible of sensitive data


**Transparency**

We have well-defined practices and methods we use to document our insights, achievements and challenges. This may sometimes limit the procedures and practices we could use, but it improves the predictability and reliability of the community as a whole.

In addition, when users understand the program's capabilities, they are less likely to be dissatisfied with their experiences in our community.


**Ethical and Compliance Considerations**

Some limitations are necessary to ensure that programs operate ethically and comply with legal standards.
