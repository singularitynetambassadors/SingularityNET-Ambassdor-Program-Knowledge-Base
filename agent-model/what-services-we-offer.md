# What services we offer?

These are areas where most of the information will be processed and where the actions are taken. We strive to be decentralised and collaborative in the ways we work. Each service can function autonomously and collaborate with other services. This means there is no single entity that controls and decides what services the Ambassador Program offers.

Each Core Contributor can offer multiple services. More about Core Contributors here: [Ambassador Program Core Contributors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13uPKVnooFowpoxRBZJH71iIbHUyoOokdn_RCDvp_RHI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ij3cuj7d158h)

Our services rapidly change due the consistently changing environment. There are always new people getting onboarded who have novel ways of working or passion to do the things we need.
