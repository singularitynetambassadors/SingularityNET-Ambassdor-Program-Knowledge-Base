# How do we store assets and experiences?

When we put thought into our ways to store our assets and experiences in a way that is accessible for both humans and machines, we can create new experiences to communicate our collective impact to our surrounding environment.&#x20;

Using our past experience provides us with a great ability to learn and adapt to address new or ongoing challenges.

We combine and try different methods and tools to reduce the operational costs of storing information.

We have put emphasis on transparency and the findability of our collective assets.
