# How Do we Exchange Value?

Resource Distribution

* The program facilitates the exchange of value through funding, resources, and tools that empower members to carry out their roles and initiatives effectively.
* Workgroups or Guilds may receive funding or resource allocations to support their specific objectives.

Service and Contribution Sharing

* Value is exchanged when members contribute their skills, time, and expertise to tasks like organizing events, creating content, or supporting community growth.
* Contributions are shared across workgroups, enhancing collaboration and collective impact.

Reputation and Recognition Systems

* Members build their reputation by completing tasks, supporting others, or demonstrating leadership. This reputation serves as a form of non-monetary value that enhances trust and credibility within the community.

Knowledge Exchange

* Members share insights, best practices, and learnings within and across Guilds, enabling a continuous flow of valuable knowledge.
* Collaboration between groups fosters innovation and strengthens the program as a whole.

Peer-to-Peer Support

* Value is exchanged informally through mentoring, advice, and collaboration among members, ensuring mutual growth and support.
