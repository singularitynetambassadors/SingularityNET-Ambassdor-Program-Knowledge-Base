# How do we mitigate potential risks?

Risk mitigation happens through implementing preventative measures, real-time monitoring, and adaptive recovery strategies.

* Transparency and auditable processes to prevent fraud and manipulation
* Decentralise distribution of funds and governance power to ensure program integrity when some members or operations are no longer reliable
* Limitations of access until proven credibility
* Different channels to voice concerns and tension
