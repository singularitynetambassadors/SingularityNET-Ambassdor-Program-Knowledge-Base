# Getting Started

## Welcome to the **Knowledge Base GitBook**

This page is an entry point into understanding and contributing to the Knowledge Base WG

This GitBook organizes core insights, processes, and systems that define how the Ambassador Program functions from onboarding and role creation to decision-making, value exchange, and risk management

## Knowledge Base Structure

The content is structured into **key categories** that reflect an area of the Ambassador Program. Each category is paired with guiding questions, definitions, and a relation to the Ambassador Program.

These categories were selected to **capture a holistic view** of how the Ambassador Program operates in a decentralised and adaptive environment.

Structure and Descriptions can be improved with suggestions and comments on the [Category Descriptions Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NzpysgIDsZFigFJz4Tiik3h2l0X4FJTJC4xEbGiwsUw)
