# Global Strategy

**Purpose:** The Global Strategy Layer is the second layer in the Autonomous Cognitive Entity model, playing a pivotal role in shaping the long-term strategic direction. This layer is akin to the ’CEO’ of the ACE, responsible for understanding the broader context, setting strategic goals, and guiding the actions of the lower layers to align with these goals. The primary output of this layer are strategic documents that serve as the roadmap. This strategic layer assesses the current state of the program and formulates plans to achieve the program’s goals.&#x20;
