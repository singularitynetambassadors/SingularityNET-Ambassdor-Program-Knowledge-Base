# What is Ambassador program?

The Ambassador Program is a decentralized initiative designed to empower and mobilize individuals to promote, educate, and support the growth of the broader ecosystem. It provides a framework for community members to contribute meaningfully through outreach, content creation, governance participation, and knowledge sharing.

The program is structured around Workgroups and Guilds, which emerge organically based on the needs and interests of the community. These groups operate autonomously, defining their own objectives, roles, and contributions while aligning with the overall mission.

The key principles of the Ambassador Program include:

* Decentralization: Workgroups and Guilds self-organize without top-down control.
* Collaboration: Members work together to advance shared goals and initiatives.
* Incentivization: Contributions are recognized through rewards, reputation, and influence.
* Education & Outreach: The program amplifies awareness and engagement within the ecosystem.

Through this structure, the Ambassador Program fosters an inclusive, adaptable, and self-sustaining network of contributors who drive value in various ways.
