# How do we plan to achieve the mission?

We ensure that the initiatives and contributions of Ambassadors align with the broader mission and vision of the ecosystem.

We encourage Workgroups and Guilds to define their own priorities and propose initiatives that align with community needs.

We provide training, mentorship, and resources to equip Ambassadors with the skills they need to succeed.

Implement feedback loops to evaluate effectiveness and adjust strategies accordingly.
