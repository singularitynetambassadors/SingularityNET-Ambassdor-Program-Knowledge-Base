# Role Definitions

**Purpose:** This layer defines what is expected from participants and stakeholders, as well as what they can expect in return from the entity. Clear expectations help align actions and reduce misunderstandings. The roles in the Ambassador Program often emerge organically, remain loosely defined, and may overlap to support dynamic and inclusive participation.
