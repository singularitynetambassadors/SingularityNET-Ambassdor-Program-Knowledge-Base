# How do we define Roles?

By fostering a decentralized, adaptive approach to role definition, the Ambassador Program encourages collaboration, innovation, and alignment with its mission while empowering individual contributors to shape their roles within the community.\
Proposal-Based Role Creation

Proposal-Based Role Creation

* Roles can be established by writing them into proposals that outline the goals and activities of Workgroups or Guilds.
* Each proposal is tailored to serve specific purposes and objectives, aligning with the overarching mission of the Ambassador Program.

Group Role Definitions

* Within each Workgroup or Guild, team members define roles as needed.
* These definitions often include particular skills, tools, or expertise required to fulfil their specific tasks and objectives.

Bottom-Up Emergence

* Roles are not imposed by the Foundation or any central authority. Instead, they emerge organically from the needs and initiatives of group members themselves.
* This grassroots approach ensures that roles remain relevant and are shaped by those directly engaged in the work.

Flexibility and Overlap

* Roles are intentionally loosely defined, without rigid boundaries.
* This flexibility allows for overlap between roles across different groups. For example, multiple documenters from different Workgroups may take meeting notes differently, reflecting their unique workflows.

Adaptability

* Roles evolve to meet the changing needs of the Program.
* This adaptability ensures the Program remains responsive to new challenges, opportunities, and member input.
