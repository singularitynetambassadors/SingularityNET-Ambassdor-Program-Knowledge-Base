# How do we manage Resources?

Resource management ensures that the assets such as time, costs and contributor effort are based on priorities and overall objectives. Includes monitoring and reporting to provide oversight. Sustainable planning prevents resource depletion.

Resource management ensures that the system can sustainably operate, scale, and achieve its goals without overextending its capacity.
