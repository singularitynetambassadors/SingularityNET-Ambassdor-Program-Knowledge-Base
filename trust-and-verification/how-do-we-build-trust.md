# How do we build trust?

Trust is built through transparency, accountability, and reliability. This includes open governance processes, reputation systems, immutable records, decentralised decision-making, and peer validation. Incentives encourage honest behaviour, while clear audit trails ensure that actions are verifiable and aligned with ethical standards.



* We put a lot of emphasis on Transparency, documentation, rules and finances.
* We recognise people and the results they can provide
