# Trust and Verification

By establishing trust, participants can engage with the system without fear of exploitation or unfair advantages. Verification mechanisms ensure that only legitimate actions, contributions, and identities are recognised, protecting the environment from bad actors and ensuring that rewards and decisions are based on verifiable proof.

These principles support decentralised governance, secure collaboration, and fair participation, allowing the system to function autonomously while maintaining accountability.
