# How do we identify new projects?

New projects are usually identified through a combination of system needs, community innovation and strategic foresight.

The process involves:

* Identifying areas where existing solutions are insufficient or outdated
* Having open ideation sessions to propose new projects
* Assess data patterns and community behaviour to ideate on new tools
* Collaborating between domains
* Testing, experimenting or simulating new ideas
