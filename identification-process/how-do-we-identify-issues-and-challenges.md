# How do we identify Issues and challenges?

To maintain stability and efficiency, the program should continuously monitor and detect problems before they escalate.

This is done through:

* Monitoring and analysis – track performance, detect inefficiencies, and flag deviations from expected behaviour.
* Collect Feedback & Reporting – Participants and members provide insights on emerging challenges, ensuring human oversight in issue identification.
