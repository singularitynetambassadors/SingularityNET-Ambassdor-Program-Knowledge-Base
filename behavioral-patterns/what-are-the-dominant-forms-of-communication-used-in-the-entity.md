# What are the dominant forms of communication used in the entity?

In the Ambassador Program, communication is structured to ensure clarity, efficiency, and inclusivity. The dominant forms of communication include:



* Asynchronous Communication - We use Discord and Public Documentation (such as meeting summaries, reporting, proposal, etc)
* Synchronous Communication - Real-time interactions through video calls, usually in Zoom
* Decision Making Communication - Can includes deliberation models, voting mechanisms, and structured proposal reviews, etc
