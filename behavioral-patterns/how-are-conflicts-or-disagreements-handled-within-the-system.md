# How are conflicts or disagreements handled within the system?

Conflict resolution within the Ambassador Program follows decentralised and transparent processes designed to maintain fairness and cooperation. The key mechanisms include:

1. Promotes self-regulation and responsibility before escalating issues further.
2. Workgroups or designated mediators help structure conversations to resolve disputes.
3. Ensures that unresolved disputes do not disrupt system functionality.
