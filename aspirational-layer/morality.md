# Morality

The Ambassador program operates on a shared moral foundation that ensures fairness, integrity, and responsible engagement. Moral principles include:

* Honesty & Transparency – Deception, misinformation, or manipulation is morally wrong, while truthful interactions and open governance are valued.
* Equity & Fairness – The system should provide equal opportunities and prevent unjust advantages or exclusion.
* Respect for Autonomy – Coercion or forced participation is not tolerated; individuals and entities must engage voluntarily.
* Harm Reduction – Any actions that cause intentional harm, exploitation, or abuse are considered unacceptable.

Responsibility & Stewardship – Participants and the system itself should act as responsible stewards, ensuring sustainability and ethical decision-making.
