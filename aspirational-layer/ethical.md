# Ethical

Ethical guidelines provide a practical framework for participants and agents to follow while interacting within the Ambassador Program. These guidelines include:

* Transparency & Accountability – Decision-making processes, resource allocation, and governance must be open and accessible.
* Consent & Data Protection – Users must have control over their data, and privacy must be respected.
* Decentralised Power & Governance – No single entity should hold excessive power, and decisions should be distributed across participants.
* Collaboration Over Competition – The system encourages cooperative behaviour rather than zero-sum competition.
* Sustainability & Long-Term Thinking – Ethical decisions should prioritize the well-being of the ecosystem over short-term gains.
