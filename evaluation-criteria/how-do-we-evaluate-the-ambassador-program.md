# How do we evaluate the Ambassador Program?

In the Ambassador Program, we are recognising both individual and group efforts and structurally collecting the information. We have established a reporting cadence to assess impact. We have also automated participation tracking and consistently involve people in decision-making. Multiple educational programs and experiments have been experimented with to help adapt to new challenges and learn new skills.
