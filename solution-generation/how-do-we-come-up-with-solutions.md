# How do we come up with solutions?

* Participants propose solutions through open channels and group discussions, which may end up in budget proposals if resources are required. The proposals go through a public feedback process for further improvements.
* Groups often report and reflect on collected data to recognise patterns and propose new solutions.
* New Ideas are encouraged and resources are allocated to test them
